## Installation

Just clone or download this repo. You'll need to install two packages.

1. Pillow is a fork of the PIL package.  It provides the Image module for this application.
to install it run the following.
```
pip install pillow
```
2. Numpy is a scientific package that helps with mathematical functions.
```
pip install numpy
```

## Examples
